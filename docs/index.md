## Welcome to the White Mountain Four Thousand Footer peak tracker 

I built this app as I love hiking the white mountains in New Hampshire. I found it difficult to know and keep track of which peaks I bagged, so I decided an iOS application could help out with this problem. The app is free and I work on it in my spare time. Let's go out there and bag some four thousand footers!

### Feedback
For any feedback and suggestions to the iOS app, please email nathanbeaumont.617@gmail.com.
